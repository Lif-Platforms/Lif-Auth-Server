<h1 align="center">ü§ù Auth Server Contributing Guidlines</h1>
<p align="center">This document provides guidelines and best practices for contributing to the Lif Platforms Auth Server project. The Auth Server is a RESTful API that handles authentication and authorization for the Lif Platforms ecosystem. It is built using Python and the FastAPI framework and relies on MySQL as the database backend.</p>

# Before you start
- Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system, along with pip and virtualenv.
- Clone the repository from GitHub and create a virtual environment for the project.
- Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [license](LICENSE) files.

# Seting Up For Development
1. **Create A Logs File** - Create a file named `/logs/logfile.log` in the root directory of the project.
2. **Setup The Database** - Setup a new MySQL database and import our [base database](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hElqxbTORPwX9QQsDuao80grOXnZNWo0?usp=sharing) into it.
3. **Configure Credentials** - Start Auth Server and wait for it to start. Once started, stop Auth Server. You should now see a `config.yml` in the project's root directory. There you can configure the credentials for your MySQL database and other things.
4. That's it! You have successfully set up Auth Server for development.

# How to contribute
- Create a new branch from the `main` branch and name it according to the feature or bug you are working on.
- Write clear and concise commit messages that explain what you have done and why.
- Write documentation for your code using docstrings and comments, following the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
- Push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request against the `main` branch.
- Wait for the code review and address any feedback or suggestions.
- Once your pull request is approved and merged, delete your branch.
