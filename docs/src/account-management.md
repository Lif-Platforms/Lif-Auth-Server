# Account Management
Auth Server doesn't just handle authentication and authorization, it also handles account management. This section will cover how account management works with Auth Server.

## User Profile
Every user has a profile. It consists of the following components:
- Username
- Pronouns
- Avatar/Profile Pic
- Banner
- Bio

Users can customize/update these components through My Lif.
> [!NOTE]
> At this time, usernames cannot be changed. This due to how Auth Server identifies accounts. Lif Platforms has plans to change this in the future.

## Security
In addition to updating user profiles, users can also manage the security of their account though My Lif. Users can change their emails, passwords, as well as setup 2FA.
